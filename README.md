# Confounder-Handling-Data-Preprocessing
The data pre-processing pipeline used for formatting the results of the corresponding simulation for LaTeX.
All input csv's must be in the "data" directory, outputs tables will appear in the "out" directory.  The entire pipeline can then be run from command line with the command "bash process_tables.sh".

Current bash script also uses the Python tool "tably" available here: https://github.com/narimiran/tably
